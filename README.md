# stunting_detection

This project presents the development and deployment of a machine learning model that classifies the nutritional status of toddlers in Indonesia. The classification uses an ensemble learning approach that combines **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** through a **Voting Classifier**.

**Data Source** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rendiputra/stunting-balita-detection-121k-rows

Classify toddlers into four nutritional status categories based on anthropometric data:
- **Severely Stunted**
- **Stunted**
- **Normal**
- **Tall**

 Summary of Findings

- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy: **98%**
- **Voting Classifier** (SVM + Random Forest) showed stable and consistent performance: **97.9%** (cross-validation)
- **SVM** accuracy: **91%**
- Ensemble learning improved overall robustness and prediction reliability
